                        <p>Sterling Archer thrives in The Danger Zone. His optimal performance is found within this zone. Lana Kane
                            is constantly irritated by this until she realises that she is actually deeply in love with Sterling. 
                            A realisation then hits her, that she can torture Mallory by having a child with Sterling and naming
                            her after her own Grandmother, instead of Mallory.</p>
